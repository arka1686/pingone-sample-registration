# PingOne for Customers User Registration Sample
The intention of this sample is to give developer a bird's eye view of the popular authentication protocol like OIDC 
and some PingOne for Customers (Ping14C) Authentication and Management API services usage, that allows you to manage your organizationâ€™s users and applications, and of course - users authorization and authentication.

It samples such flows like - register a new user, update user password by logged in user or by application itself, and recover a forgotten password scenario.

## Installation Steps
1. Add Ping14C `spring-boot-sdk` artifact to your pom:
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.pingidentity.samples</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>${sdk.version}</version>
    </dependency>
```
You may want to add additional dependency to make your application development experience a little more pleasant, like [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html)
Since we are using Thymeleaf template engine, you can benefit from `spring.thymeleaf.cache` that controls compiled templates cache to avoid repeatedly parsing template files.

2. Until we are storing `spring-boot-sdk` jar in GitHub with [GitHub Maven Plugins](https://github.com/github/maven-plugins)(that should not be a case until at least [October of 2019](https://rawgit.com/)), please add this server configuration to your maven `settings.xml`:
```xml
<server>
  <id>github</id>
  <password>OAUTH2TOKEN</password>
</server>
```
where `OAUTH2TOKEN` is a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) you need to create (unless you have some) if you have Two-factor Authentication, or
```xml
<server>
  <id>github</id>
  <username>GitHubLogin</username>
  <password>GitHubPassw0rd</password>
</server>
```
in a simple user:password case.

Please don't forget to set `OAUTH2TOKEN` as environment variable(if you are using it) for login failures prevention:
```bash
 export GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN={OAUTH2TOKEN}
``` 

3. Create two [applications](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_AuthActivities/p1-a_appAuth/) through Ping14C admin console with the following configurations:
 - __Non-interactive or Advanced Configuration__ (with *Client Credentials* Grant Type) with such list of PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - `p1:create:env:user` - to create a new user
    - `p1:read:env:user` - to find a user by email or name before resetting its password
    - `p1:delete:env:user` - to delete a user when its passwords doesn't meet password policy requirements and application stop the registration process. User creation and password setting are 2 different endpoints. 
    - `p1:read:env:population` - to get environment population a new user will belong to (registration flow) 
    - `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to set user password on new user registration
    - `p1:read:env:passwordPolicy` - to get default password policy for password client side verification
    - `p1:recover:env:userPassword` - to recover a forgotten password
 
 - __Native, Single Page or Web Application__ (with *Authorization Code* or *Implicit* Grant Type) with such list of OIDC and PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - OIDC: `openid,profile,phone,email,address`
    - PingOne's : `p1:reset:userPassword`, `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to change user password by the user

Most of PingOne platform scopes are self-explanatory, but if you need more details about them please check ["Configure access through scopes"](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_AuthActivities/p1-a_AccessServices/) part.

4. Enable both applications in Ping14C admin console.

5. Configure your spring application configuration `application.yml` by replacing all `<...>` placeholders with the following information:
    - `<environment_id>` with your environment ID
    - __Non-interactive (or Advanced Configuration) Application__ configuration in `oauth2.client` path copying over data from corresponding application from Ping14C admin console:
      - `<client_credentials_client_id>` with your client id (in `client-id` variable)
      - `<client_credentials_client_secret>` with your client secret (in `client-secret` variable)
    - __Native (Single Page or Web) Application__ configuration in `spring.security.oauth2.client` path 
      - `<authorization_code_client_id>` with your client id (in `clientId` variable)
      - `<authorization_code_client_client_credentials_client_secret>` with your client secret (in `clientSecret` variable)

## Developer Tips

__application.yml__
+ `authorizationGrantType` or `authorization-grant-type`: OAuth 2.0 defines four authorization grant types, but Spring Boot supports only 3: authorization_code, implicit, and client_credentials.

__pom.xml__
+ [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) - set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant.
+ [`<artifactId>spring-boot-sdk</artifactId>`](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingone-customers-spring-boot-tools/tree/mvn-repo/com/pingidentity/samples/spring-boot-sdk) - PingOne for Customers spring-boot SDK that is temporarily stored in github raw
