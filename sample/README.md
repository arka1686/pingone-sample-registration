# PingOne for Customers User Registration Sample
The intention of this sample is to give developer a bird's eye view of the popular authentication protocol like OIDC 
and some PingOne for Customers (Ping14C) Authentication and Management API services usage, that allows you to manage your organizationâ€™s users and applications, and of course - users authorization and authentication.

It samples such flows like - register a new user, update user password by logged in user or by application itself, and recover a forgotten password scenario.

## Installation Steps
1. Add Ping14C `spring-boot-sdk` artifact to your pom:
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.pingidentity.samples</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>${sdk.version}</version>
    </dependency>
```
You may want to add additional dependency to make your application development experience a little more pleasant, like [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html)
Since we are using Thymeleaf template engine, you can benefit from `spring.thymeleaf.cache` that controls compiled templates cache to avoid repeatedly parsing template files.

2. Create two applications through Ping14C admin console with the following configurations:
 - Non-interactive or Web Application (for Client Credentials Application Type) with such list of PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - `p1:create:env:user` - to create a new user
    - `p1:read:env:user` - to find a user by email or name before resetting its password
    - `p1:delete:env:user` - to delete a user when its passwords doesn't meet password policy requirements and application stop the registration process. User creation and password setting are 2 different endpoints. 
    - `p1:read:env:population` - to get environment population a new user will belong to (registration flow) 
    - `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to set user password on new user registration
    - `p1:read:env:passwordPolicy` - to get default password policy for password client side verification
    - `p1:recover:env:userPassword` - to recover a forgotten password
 
 - Native or Web Application (for Authorization Code Application Type) with such list of OIDC and PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - OIDC: `openid,profile,phone,email,address`
    - PingOne's : `p1:reset:self:userPassword`, `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to change user password by the user

Most of PingOne platform scopes are self-explanatory, but if you need more details about them please check ["Configure access through scopes"](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_AuthActivities/p1-a_AccessServices/) part.

3. Enable both applications in Ping14C admin console.

4. Configure your spring application configuration `application.yml` by replacing all `<...>` placeholders with the following information:
    - your environment ID in `ping.environmentId`
    - Non-interactive (or Web) Application configuration in `oauth2.client` path copying over data from corresponding application from Ping14C admin console:
      - `clientId`
      - `clientSecret`
      - `accessTokenUri`
      - `userAuthorizationUri`
      - `scopes` (adjust it to your use cases)
    - Native (or Web) Application configuration in `spring.security.oauth2.client` path 
      - `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.pingidentity`: `client-id`,`client-secret`, `provider` (can be renamed to other one, but should be correlative with `spring.security.oauth2.client.provider` name)
      - `spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.pingidentity`: `issuer-uri`


## Developer Tips

__application.yml__
+ `authorizationGrantType` or `authorization-grant-type`: OAuth 2.0 defines four authorization grant types, but Spring Boot supports only 3: authorization_code, implicit, and client_credentials.

__pom.xml__
+ [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) - set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant.
