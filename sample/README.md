# PingOne for Customers User Registration Sample
The intention of this sample is to give developer a bird's eye view of the popular authentication protocol like OIDC 
and some PingOne for Customers (Ping14C) Authentication and Management API services usage, that allows you to manage your organizationâ€™s users and applications, and of course - users authorization and authentication.

It samples such flows like - register a new user, update user password by logged in user or by application itself, and recover a forgotten password scenario.

## Installation Steps
1. Add Ping14C `spring-boot-sdk` artifact to your pom:
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.pingidentity.samples</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>${sdk.version}</version>
    </dependency>
```
You may want to add additional dependency to make your application development experience a little more pleasant, like [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html)
Since we are using Thymeleaf template engine, you can benefit from `spring.thymeleaf.cache` that controls compiled templates cache to avoid repeatedly parsing template files.

2. Create two applications through Ping14C admin console with the following configurations:
 - Non-interactive or Web Application (for Client Credentials Application Type) with such list of PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - `p1:create:env:user` - to create a new user
    - `p1:read:env:user` - to find a user by email or name before resetting its password
    - `p1:delete:env:user` - to delete a user when its passwords doesn't meet password policy requirements and application stop the registration process. User creation and password setting are 2 different endpoints. 
    - `p1:read:env:population` - to get environment population a new user will belong to (registration flow) 
    - `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to set user password on new user registration
    - `p1:read:env:passwordPolicy` - to get default password policy for password client side verification
    - `p1:recover:env:userPassword` - to recover a forgotten password
 
 - Native or Web Application (for Authorization Code Application Type) with such list of OIDC and PingOne platform `scope`'s:
    - OIDC: `openid,profile,phone,email,address`
    - PingOne's : `p1:reset:userPassword`, `p1:set:env:userPassword` - to change user password by the user

Most of PingOne platform scopes are self-explanatory, but if you need more details about them please check ["Configure access through scopes"](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_AuthActivities/p1-a_AccessServices/) part.

3. Enable both applications in Ping14C admin console.

4. Configure your spring application configuration `application.yml` by replacing all `<...>` placeholders with the following information:
    - `<environment_id>` with your environment ID
    - Non-interactive (or Web) Application configuration in `oauth2.client` path copying over data from corresponding application from Ping14C admin console:
      - `<client_credentials_client_id>` with your client id (in `client-id` variable)
      - `<client_credentials_client_secret>` with your client secret (in `client-secret` variable)
    - Native (or Web) Application configuration in `spring.security.oauth2.client` path 
      - `<authorization_code_client_id>` with your client id (in `clientId` variable)
      - `<authorization_code_client_client_credentials_client_secret>` with your client secret (in `clientSecret` variable)


## PingOne for Customers API used in this sample
### Authentication API:

| [`POST /{environmentId}/as/token`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_Authorize/#Obtain-an-access-token)  | Obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant (__spring__ uses under the hood) |
| [`GET /{environmentID}/as/.well-known/openid-configuration`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_Authorize/#Obtain-OpenID-provider-configuration-information)  | Get OpenID Connect provider metadata document for the issuer (__spring__ uses under the hood) |
| [`GET /{environmentId}/as/userinfo`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/auth/p1-a_Authorize/#UserInfo-endpoint)  | Get token claims about the authenticated end user ( used for `Show User Information` button) ||

### Management API:
| Service Name  |    Endpoint   |    Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Populations   | [`GET /environments/{environmentId}/populations`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Populations/#Get-populations)  |Get all populations for a new user registration |
| Password policies  | [`GET /environments/{environmentId}/passwordPolicies`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Passwords/#Get-one-password-policy)  |Get all password policies for an environment to get the default one. It will be used for password verification on the client side   |
| User password management  | [`PUT /environments/{environmentId}/users/{userId}/password`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Users/p1_Password/#Update-a-users-password)  | Update a password: self-change password update and administrative-change reset of user password |
|  | [`POST /environments/{environmentId}/users/{userId}/password`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Users/p1_Password/#Recover-password)  | Recover a forgotten password |
| Users | [`GET /environments/{environmentId}/users?filter=name.family%20eq%20%22Smith%22%20and%20name.given%20sw%20%22W%22`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Users/#Users)  | Find a user by his name or email for further usage of his ID |
|  | [`POST /environments/{environmentId}/users`](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/customer/v1/api/man/p1_Users/#Users)  | Create new user |


## Developer Tips

__application.yml__
+ `authorizationGrantType` or `authorization-grant-type`: OAuth 2.0 defines four authorization grant types, but Spring Boot supports only 3: authorization_code, implicit, and client_credentials.

__pom.xml__
+ [`<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) - set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant.
